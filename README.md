# roguelike

This is a roguelike game made in python using the libtcodpy library.  This game can be run by cloning the repository and running main.py.  It is fashioned in a more traditional sense in that everything is represented as purely ascii characters.  All controls are done through the keyboard.   You move and attack with the arrows keys or the numpad.  The inventory is accessed by pressig 'i'.  All other controls should be displayed on the screen.

Currently Linux and Windows are supported with 32 bit versions of python 2.7
